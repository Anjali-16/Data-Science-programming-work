# Data-Science-programming-work

This repository contains about the mini projects, inclass execerses, and weekly exercises that i have done in my data science programming course.

It contains the the projects that i solved with supervised machine learning algorithims, neural networks , Auto encoders.

Each folder contains a particular algorithim and its application on a particualr data set


Week 1: Introduction to Data science and Machine learning:

I have learnt the basics of the data science and basic terms and end to end process in Machine learning. I got introduced to jupyter lab Environment and learnt the basics of Jupyter lab about markdown, syntax of printing image in markdown. I worked on data cleaning part and preprocessing the data and make the data ready for modleing. I have understood the concept of one hot encoding and dummy encoding and applied to the airbnb data set.


Week 2:  Regression:

I got introduced to regression techniques . I became strong in the concepts of simple linear regression, multivariable linear regression, polynomial regression and logistic regression. I applied to the airbnb data set . I observed how the each regression performs on data set . I also experimented by creating a dtaa set and added some noise and experiemnted it. I also got introduced to the topics of regularization techniques called Ridge regression, Lasso regression, early stopping, elasticnet, l2_l1.


Week 3:  Support vector machines.

In this week I went through the process of how svm works and the three differnet types of kernel in SVM linear, RBF, Polynomial . I understood the differnece between svm and logistic regression. I applied SVM to riding mowers , cancer treatment data set. I evaluted the performance of each model. I created web interface for my model so that when we enter the input we can get whether the the owner will get the ownership or not. 

Week 4: Decision trees:

I understood the concepts of decison trees bais, variance, entropy, gini index and hyperparameter tuning grid search cv, random search cv. I applied decision trees to universal bank data set and evalute the performnace of my model.

Week 5 : Ensemble techniques:

I got introduced to various ensembling techniques like bagging and boosting. Random forest, Ada boost, XGboost techniques. I applied these techniques to data set and observed the performance of each models.

Week 6 : Text Mining
This is one interesting topic that I enjoyed. I got introduced to Lemmatization and tokenisation techniques. IDF, POS tagging etc. I applied the technique called Single value decomposition, reqularised technique called early stopping to NEWS data set and evaluted the model performance .

Week 7 : Neural networks:

I got introduced to the basic concepts of neural networks and got familirized with perceptrons, simple ANN. I applid the concept of using MLP classifier to hand written digits data set and evaluted the model performance.

Week 8: Deep neural networks:

I got introduced to the concept of deep neural networks. In this i learnt the Keras library  and tensorflow frmmework and applied to handwritten data set and observed the perfromance of model on my data set.

Week 9 : CNN (Convolution Neural Networks):  I understoood the concept of CNN and applied to the images that contains different apples. I evaluted the perfromance of the model.

Week 10 : RNN (Recurrent Neural networks) : I undertood the concept of the Timeseries and sequential analysis. I have taken
